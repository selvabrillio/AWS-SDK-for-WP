5) Requirements

In order to install and use the AWS SDK for Windows Phone, the following are required:
- Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone (or higher)
- Windows Phone SDK
You can download these tools from: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=27570 
In order to learn more about Windows Phone development, visit the following site: http://create.msdn.com/


6) Install AWS SDK for Windows Phone

Download the MSI file from this location: https://github.com/downloads/Microsoft-Interop/WP7-SDK-for-AWS/AWSWP7Setup.msi and run it.
Note that you can access the course code of this open source project from the Microsoft-Interop section of GitHub.
 
Follow the prompts and once complete files will be installed to the default location (C:\Program Files (x86)\AWS SDK for WP7).


7) Description of Installed Files

Within the installation directory the Bin subfolder contains the two files you'll need to add to your Windows Phone project. AWSWP7SDK.dll is the AWS library and app.config is the configuration file in which you'll specify your AWS account keys.

  
8) Create a new Windows Phone project

The SDK can be used in conjunction with an existing Windows Phone project but the purposes of this guide we’ll be starting from scratch. Start Visual Studio and create a new project. Select a Visual C# Silverlight for Windows Phone template. Give the project a name and click OK.

 
9) Add AWS References to the project

In order to access AWS functionality we must make references within your project to the libraries we've just installed. Within the solution explorer right-click on the project name and select "Add Reference..." then navigate to the Browse tab and select AWSWP7SDK.dll from C:\Program Files (x86)\AWS SDK for WP7\Bin.
  
Right-click again and select "Add > Existing Item..." then select the app.config file from the same directory.


10) Edit App.Config

In order for the application to access AWS it will need references to your account information. Open the added app.config file by double-clicking on it within the solution explorer and replace the text within the Application Settings section with your specific AWS account keys as indicated. Save the file.

 
11) Using the AWS Namespace

One you've completed the above tasks you can then add references to the Amazon namespaces via the "using" keyword.

 
12) Start Writing Code

Now you’re ready to start implementing AWS functionality into your existing or new Windows Phone project. Demo webcasts are available which outline each of the samples included with the SDK:

13) Note about building the msi from source code

The setup project in the source code is not included in the build by default. Before building it, make sure that you modify the solution to strong name sign AWSWP7SDK.dll, otherwise the installer will not be able to add it to the GAC. You may find more details on strong name signing at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h4fa028b%28v=vs.80%29.aspx
